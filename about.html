    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! I’m Kush Puri, a B.Tech undergraduate at Newton School of Technology, specializing in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. I’m passionate about coding and constantly exploring new technologies to enhance my skills. My expertise lies in frontend development, where I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React to build interactive and visually appealing web experiences.</p>

        <p>Before stepping into the world of coding, I worked as a freelance graphic designer, video editor, and background animator, collaborating with multiple clients on various creative projects. From designing eye-catching posters to editing engaging videos and crafting smooth animations, I’ve always loved bringing ideas to life.</p>
        
       <p> Now, I’m channeling that creativity into web development, merging design with functionality to create seamless and user-friendly digital experiences. Always eager to learn and take on new challenges, I strive to push my boundaries and grow as a developer. </p>
